# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** 400 characters  
**Overlap:** 80 characters  

The `campus_life` corpus consists of 88 short student-written documents averaging approximately 317 characters (ranging from 178 to 554 characters). The starter's baseline fixed-window chunker used 800 characters with 120 character overlap, which left all 88 documents un-split as single chunks. However, arbitrarily chopping at character boundaries on multi-topic posts causes severed sentences and strips crucial context (such as the document title naming the dining hall or residence hall).

I set the chunk size to 400 characters with 80 characters of overlap and replaced the chunking logic with a paragraph- and sentence-boundary aware strategy (`chunker.py::split_documents`). Single-topic posts under 400 characters remain intact as cohesive standalone chunks (~70% of the corpus). For longer documents that cover multiple distinct facets (e.g., room layout, laundry fees, and noise ratings), the chunker splits along paragraph breaks and sentences, prepending the document title to each subsequent chunk. This ensures that every chunk remains an independently answerable, complete thought.

## Sample Chunks

**Chunk 1** — source: `admin_add_drop_deadline.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
On the add/drop deadline

You can add a course through the end of the second week. Dropping is a longer window — through the end of week six — but a drop after week two shows as a W on your transcript. Nothing anywhere on the registrar's site says this plainly, and students find out from each other.
```

**Chunk 2** — source: `course_biol_160_exams.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
BIOL 160 Cell Biology — assessment

Four unit tests and a cumulative final. Not curved.

The unit tests come fast, roughly every three weeks; falling behind once is very hard to recover from.
```

**Chunk 3** — source: `course_math_220.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
MATH 220 Linear Algebra

I lived here my sophomore year. Format is chalk-and-talk lecture, weekly problem sets marked for correctness. Assessment: two midterms and a cumulative final. Curved to a b- median.

Expect 6 to 8 hours a week, almost all of it on problem sets.

The one piece of advice: the problem sets are the course; the lectures make sense afterwards rather than during.
```

**Chunk 4** — source: `dining_the_atrium.txt#1` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
The Atrium

Hours are 8:00am to 6:00pm weekdays. Costs one meal swipe for a sandwich-plus-drink combination, or à la carte.
```

**Chunk 5** — source: `housing_innisfree_hall_laundry.txt#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Laundry in Innisfree Hall

Machines take $1.75 wash, $1.75 dry, app-based. There are eight washers and six dryers for the building, which is the wrong ratio and means the dryers back up on Sunday evenings.

Best time to do laundry here is Tuesday or Wednesday morning. Sunday after 6pm you will wait.
```

## Sample Answer

     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:**

**Answer:**

```
```

**My relevance cutoff:**

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?
